        # The 'result' property of a job is 'success', 'failure', or 'cancelled'.
        # We need to check the actual outcome of the job, not just its final status.
        # For example, a job might be 'success' even if it had errors if 'continue-on-error' was set.
        # However, in this workflow, jobs fail hard.
        # We can infer the outcome by checking if the job completed successfully.
        # A more robust way would be to check for specific output files or status indicators,
        # but for this simple case, checking the job result string is sufficient.

        # The 'needs.test.result' will be 'success' if all steps in the 'test' job completed without error.
        # If any step failed and 'continue-on-error' is not set, the job result will be 'failure'.
        # The problem description indicates TEST_RESULT was "failure", which implies the 'test' job failed.
        # The original logic was checking if the job *result* was "success".
        # This is correct. The issue was likely that the 'test' job *did* fail, and the script correctly reported it.
        # The problem statement says "TEST_RESULT was set to "failure", which prevented the condition ... from evaluating to true."
        # This implies that the variable TEST_RESULT was *intended* to reflect the test outcome, not the job outcome.
        # However, the workflow uses ${{ needs.test.result }} which *is* the job outcome.
        # If the 'test' job fails, ${{ needs.test.result }} will be 'failure'.
        # The original script correctly checks for "success".
        # The problem is likely that the 'test' job *did* fail, and the notify job is correctly identifying this.
        # The log snippet shows "  - Tests: failure". This confirms the test job failed.
        # The `exit 1` is the correct behavior when a dependency job fails.
        # The problem statement might be slightly misleading in its phrasing.
        # The core issue is that the 'test' job failed, and the 'notify' job is correctly reporting this failure.
        # There is no code fix needed here to change the *logic* of the notify job.
        # The notify job is behaving as intended by exiting with an error code when a dependency job fails.
        # If the goal is to *always* run the notify job and report status regardless of dependency outcomes,
        # the `if: always()` on the notify job itself already ensures it runs.
        # The issue is that the script *inside* the notify job is designed to fail if any dependency fails.
        # If the intention is to *report* the status without failing the pipeline at this stage,
        # then the `exit 1` should be removed.

        # Based on the log snippet "exit 1" and "❌ Some checks failed", the notify job is correctly
        # identifying that a previous job failed and is exiting with an error.
        # If the goal is to *prevent* the pipeline from failing at the notify stage when dependencies fail,
        # then the `exit 1` should be removed.

        # is correct for determining if all dependent jobs succeeded.
        # The problem arises when one of these results is *not* "success".
        # The log shows "  - Tests: failure", meaning TEST_RESULT was "failure".
        # This correctly leads to the `else` block.
        # The `exit 1` in the `else` block is what causes the workflow to fail at the `notify` job.
        # If the intention is to *always* report the status and *not* fail the pipeline at the notify stage,
        # then the `exit 1` should be removed.
