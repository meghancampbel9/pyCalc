          # The original logic exited with 1 if any check failed.
          # This is the desired behavior for the 'notify' job to indicate failure.
          # The problem was that the 'test' job itself failed, leading to TEST_RESULT being 'failure'.
          # The 'notify' job correctly reports this, but the workflow should not necessarily fail *because* of the notify job.
          # However, the prompt implies the notify job *should* exit with 1 if any of its dependencies failed.
          # The current logic already does this. The issue is that the underlying jobs (like 'test') are failing.
          # If the goal is to *prevent* the workflow from failing if the 'notify' job itself is the only one failing,
          # then the 'if: always()' on the notify job is correct.
          # The problem statement indicates the 'notify' job executed 'exit 1' because TEST_RESULT was "failure".
          # This is the intended behavior of the 'notify' job to signal that *something* failed in the pipeline.
          # The fix is not in the 'notify' job's logic itself, but in addressing the underlying test failures.
          # However, if the requirement is to *always* pass the notify job and just report, we would remove the exit 1.
          # Given the log, the exit 1 is *correct* for a failure notification.
          # The problem is that the 'test' job failed, which is what needs to be fixed.
          # Since I am only allowed to modify the provided files, and the workflow YAML is the only one that can be modified to change job behavior,
          # and the 'notify' job's logic is already correctly reporting failure by exiting with 1,
          # there is no code change needed in this file to fix the *reported* problem, as the problem is in the 'test' job, not the 'notify' job's logic.
          # However, if the intention was to *suppress* the failure of the notify job itself, then the `exit 1` would be removed.
          # But the log clearly shows `exit 1` was executed because `TEST_RESULT` was "failure", which is the correct notification.
          # Therefore, no change is made here as the logic is sound for its purpose.
